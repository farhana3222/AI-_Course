# 🤖 AI Tools Exploration – Video & Presentation

This project is part of our Artificial Intelligence course and includes two components:

1. 🎥 A short **AI course summary video** created using **Pictory AI**
2. 📊 A 10-slide **AI course presentation** designed using **Gamma AI**

Both were created using AI tools based entirely on guidance and content generated through **ChatGPT**.

## 📽️ Video Creation – Using Pictory AI

**Tool Used:** [Pictory AI](https://pictory.ai)

### 🔧 Steps:
1. The video script was prepared with the help of ChatGPT, summarizing theoretical concepts like BFS, DFS, A*, agents, and lab activities including Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and Connect Four with Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.
2. I visited [https://pictory.ai](https://pictory.ai) and selected the **“Script to Video”** option.
3. After pasting the script, Pictory generated a video with matching visuals and subtitles.
4. I chose a clean theme, added relevant background music, and made small visual adjustments.
5. The video was exported in MP4 format.

## 📑 Presentation Slide – Using Gamma AI

**Tool Used:** [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app)

### 🔧 Steps:
1. With ChatGPT’s help, I created a structured prompt to summarize the full AI course into 10 slides.
2. I went to [https://gamma.app](https://gamma.app) and used the **AI presentation generator**.
3. I pasted the prompt, selected a minimal and professional theme.
4. Gamma generated all slides with titles, bullet points, and visual formatting.
5. After reviewing and final edits, the slides were exported as a PDF.
