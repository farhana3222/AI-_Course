# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course 


Welcome to the complete summary of my **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** course, part of the **CSE undergraduate curriculum at North East University Bangladesh**.  
This repository documents everything I explored and implemented over a **6-month journey** — combining theoretical concepts with real-world applications through lab work and intelligent systems development.

## 🎯 Course Purpose

This course was designed to build a strong foundation in classical and modern AI techniques.  
From search algorithms to logic systems, from smart game strategies to machine learning basics — we explored how machines can be made to think, learn, and solve problems just like humans.

---

## 🧠 Core Learning Areas

This course was divided into **two key parts**:
- 📘 **Theory**: Understanding how intelligent systems are modeled, solved, and represented.
- 🧪 **Lab**: Implementing those ideas in code to build working AI systems and games.

---

## 🔍 Search Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Iterative Deepening Search**  
- **Depth-Limited Search**  
- **Bidirectional Search**

Each search technique was implemented with sample problems like pathfinding in grids and tree traversal, exploring efficiency in time and space.

## 🌟 Heuristic-Based Search

- **Best First Search**  
- **A\* Algorithm**  
- **AO\* Algorithm**  

These algorithms helped solve problems more intelligently by using heuristics — reducing unnecessary exploration.

---

## 🧗 Advanced Techniques

- **Hill Climbing** – Greedy ascent approach for local optimization  
- **Beam Search** – A memory-efficient, heuristic-driven BFS variant  

---

## 🕹️ Game AI Projects

- **Tic Tac Toe**: Implemented with the Minimax algorithm for perfect play  
- **Chess (Simplified)**: Enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning for performance  
- **Connect Four**: Depth-limited Minimax used for strategic gameplay
