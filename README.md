# üß† Artificial Intelligence Course Overview

## i.Purpose of this Course
This course was designed to introduce the fundamental principles and methodologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It aimed to build a strong conceptual base around how AI systems are structured and function, along with how they can be applied to solve both abstract and real-world problems. Emphasis was placed on understanding key terminologies, exploring different types of search strategies, and seeing how AI can enhance decision-making, especially in dynamic domains like games.

## üìö What I Learned

- AI : agents, environments, and state space search  
- Uninformed and informed search strategies (BFS, DFS, A*, etc.)  
- Game algorithms: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning  
- Real-world applications like NLP, robotics, and knowledge representation  
- Built practical AI-powered games: Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Connect Four
