# 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Course Overview

## i.Purpose of this Course
This course was designed to introduce the fundamental principles and methodologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It aimed to build a strong conceptual base around how AI systems are structured and function, along with how they can be applied to solve both abstract and real-world problems. Emphasis was placed on understanding key terminologies, exploring different types of search strategies, and seeing how AI can enhance decision-making, especially in dynamic domains like games.

## ii.Key Learnings from the Course
Over the span of this course, I acquired both theoretical and hands-on knowledge in the following core areas:

### 🔍 Uninformed Search Techniques:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**
- **Bidirectional Search**

### 💡 Informed Search & Heuristics:
- **Heuristic-Based Search**
- **Best-First Search**
- **A\* (A-Star) Algorithm**
- **AO\* Algorithm**
- **Hill Climbing**
- **Beam Search**

### 🕹️ Game AI & Decision-Making:
- **Minimax Algorithm**
  

These concepts were not just explored in theory but also applied practically. I implemented AI decision-making using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning in several interactive games including:
- ♟️ **Chess**
- ❌⭕ **Tic-Tac-Toe**
- 🟡🔴 **Connect Four**

Through these projects, I gained insight into how AI simulates intelligent behavior in turn-based strategy games by evaluating moves ahead of time and making optimal decisions.

## iii.Course Duration
The course was conducted over a period of **6 months**

## iv.Course Supervised By
**Razorshi Prozzwal Talukder**  
Lecturer, North East University Bangladesh
