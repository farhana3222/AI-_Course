# 🟡🔴 Connect Four – AI Game in Python

This is a graphical **Connect Four** game built using Python and **Pygame**. It features an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning** for improved efficiency. This project is part of an Artificial Intelligence course.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Minimax Algorithm**: AI evaluates possible moves and their outcomes to make optimal decisions.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhances Minimax by cutting off unnecessary branches, reducing computation.
- The AI plays as Player 2 (YELLOW) and tries to win or block your winning path.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pygame library

Install Pygame via pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/connect-four-ai.git
cd connect-four-ai
```

2. Run the game:

```bash
python connect_four.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play

- The game is played on a **7x6 grid**.
- You play as **RED**, and the AI plays as **YELLOW**.
