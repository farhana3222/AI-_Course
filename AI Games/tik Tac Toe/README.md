# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe – AI Game in Python

This is a simple command-line **Tic Tac Toe** game built in Python for an Artificial Intelligence course. The game features an unbeatable AI opponent that uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to play optimally.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI evaluates all possible future game states and chooses the optimal move.
- Ensures the AI never loses (perfect play).
- Time Complexity: O(9!) ≈ constant due to the small board size.
